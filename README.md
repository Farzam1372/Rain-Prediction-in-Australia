# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia
This project was done as a part of the Honors portion of the IBM Machine Learning Course on Coursera [January 2024]

Built a classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day or not.
Used a rainfall dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data. Used classification algorithms to create a model based on the training data and evaluated the testing data using various evaluation metrics.

Used these algorithms:

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM
Evaluated the models using:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
